# Zebrunner Agent Core - Java

Java Agent Core is meant to be used for simplified agent development for test frameworks written in Java programming language.
Core provides a convenient client for Zebrunner REST APIs, alongside with components designed to keep track of test run state during it's execution.
Core interface that is meant to be used by agent developers is `TestRunRegistrar`. 

Feel free to support the development with a [**donation**](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=MNHYYCYHAKUVA) for the next improvements.
